# Phoney Connect

Welcome to Phoney Connect! The game where you have to solve every clue at once.

This started as a challenge to "name" the final category of a certain other connections game, but that proved difficult as the actual category descriptions are far too nebulous.

## Rules

Use the four color pickers to "paint" each element together with its category. The exact color does not matter, but you may only submit a valid 4x4 board. You will be alerted if you have only two answers wrong.

## Platforms

Currently the game is doing a simple track of screen width at 400px. Futher enhancements coming soon!

## Current Features:

- View Archives! View previous wins and number of attempts
- Sort, Shuffle & Clear
- Updates Daily

## Motive

- The other guys stole their game too
- I wanted to make a version that stored stats on the browser but wasn't "hackable"
